# Arduino-CLI integration

Improves the Arduino development experience by asking questions you _can_ answer and offering you just those settings and options that apply to the gear you actually have. Compiler and header file paths and pragmas are updated automatically as a result of adding or removing a library.

## Features

Arduino CLI integration on Mac, Linux and Windows

* Robust - not dependent on fragile Node native integration
* Automatic - libraries and toolchains are fetched and installed automatically to support your selections. Compiler paths for VS Code and `include` pragmas for library header files are generated by your board and library selections.
* Simple - you work with probably one or two kinds of Arduino, you use one operating system on your computer, you program your Arduinos with one kind of programmer. Once you provide this environmental info, the options you have to choose from are only the ones that actually apply to the gear you have.
* Flexible - you can always add a new kind of Arduino or programmer.

## Requirements

* Arduino CLI

## Extension Settings

Arduino CLI integration is highly configurable. Settings can be modified by going to Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Arduino-CLI.

**A detailed breakdown of these settings can be found in [the manual](https://github.com/PeterWone/vsc-print/blob/master/manual.md).**
