# Translators wanted
I speak English well and French badly. If you want documentation in some other language, this is your chance to shine. It's not a big burden now that the extension is more or less complete and stable. It's fun to see one's name up in lights, and a real service to your countrymen. Of course this does mean you need to do a good job of it.

# Submitting changes
1. Raise an issue and describe the change you think is needed. 
2. Discuss it with whoever takes an interest. 
3. If you are capable of making the change yourself, fork the project and implement your change. 
If you do this yourself you stand a high chance of getting exactly what you want. 
Otherwise, it's up to you to convince someone else of the value of your idea.
4. It doesn't matter whether your change has wide appeal so long as it does not pose a problem for others.
5. Update the manual as required.
6. Don't worry about the changelog or readme, I'll take care of that when I merge (unless you are a translator).
7. Submit a PR with any information I'll need to update the changelog and the readme.

# Submitting translations
Unless you can find someone able to review your translations, skip to step three of submitting changes. There are instructions in the manual on how to translation material must be organised.
